# SnorlaxScript: A Programming Language Development Series

Welcome to the SnorlaxScript development series! In this repository, we embark on a journey to create a programming language called SnorlaxScript. Our goal is to build a language that is expressive, powerful, and easy to use. Throughout this series, we'll explore various aspects of language design, implementation, and optimization.

## Introduction

SnorlaxScript is designed to be a versatile scripting language suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple scripting tasks to complex software development projects. Our focus is on creating a language that strikes a balance between simplicity and functionality, allowing developers to write clean, concise code without sacrificing power or expressiveness.

## What We'll Cover

- **Language Design**: We'll start by defining the syntax and semantics of SnorlaxScript, laying the foundation for its development.
  
- **Parser Development**: We'll build a parser to translate SnorlaxScript code into a format that our interpreter or compiler can understand.
  
- **Semantic Analysis**: We'll implement semantic analysis to ensure that SnorlaxScript code follows the language's rules and conventions.
  
- **Code Generation**: Depending on our goals, we may develop either an interpreter or a compiler to execute SnorlaxScript code.
  
- **Standard Library**: We'll design and implement a standard library to provide essential functionality to SnorlaxScript developers.
  
- **Optimization**: We'll explore techniques to optimize SnorlaxScript code for performance and efficiency.
  
- **Documentation**: We'll document the language's features, syntax, and usage to help developers learn and use SnorlaxScript effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with SnorlaxScript development, clone this repository and follow along with the series. Each part will focus on a specific aspect of language development, providing explanations, code samples, and exercises to help you understand and implement SnorlaxScript features.
